# Module 2, Lesson 4: The Tai-Form (Want / Don't Want)

**Objective:** To learn how to express your desires.

---

### **Core Concept: Expressing Desire**

The Tai-Form changes a verb from "to do" into "want to do."

### **The Golden Rule**

-   Just like the Potential Form, the object of your desire often uses **が (ga)** to emphasize what you want.

### **The Hindi "Aha" Moment 💡**

-   This is the direct equivalent of adding **`चाहता हूँ` (chahta hoon)** to a verb.

### **How to Make the Tai-Form (All 4 Variations)**

The base is made by taking the verb stem (the part before `ます`) and adding `〜たい`.



1.  **I want to... (`〜たいです`)**
    -   `お寿司**が**食べ**たいです**。` (Osushi **ga** tabe**tai desu**.)
    -   I want to eat sushi.

2.  **I wanted to... (`〜たかったです`)**
    -   `お寿司**が**食べ**たかったです**。` (Osushi **ga** tabe**takatta desu**.)
    -   I wanted to eat sushi.

3.  **I don't want to... (`〜たくないです`)**
    -   `会社に行き**たくないです**。` (Kaisha ni iki**takunai desu**.)
    -   I don't want to go to the company.

4.  **I didn't want to... (`〜たくなかったです`)**
    -   `外に出**たくなかったです**。` (Soto ni de**takunakatta desu**.)
    -   I didn't want to go outside.

### **Key Takeaway**

The Tai-Form is your go-to grammar for expressing what you want, wanted, don't want, and didn't want to do. Just remember the four endings.

# Module 1, Lesson 2: The Object Particle を (o)

**Objective:** To identify the noun that is directly affected by the verb.

---

### **Core Concept: The Direct Object**

The particle **を (o)** always comes after the noun that is receiving the action of the verb. It answers the question, "The verb is happening to *what*?"

### **The Hindi "Aha" Moment 💡**

-   **を (o)** is a direct equivalent of the object marker **को (ko)**, even when it's sometimes hidden in spoken Hindi.

### **Examples in Context**

#### **Scenario 1: Daily Routine**

-   **Japanese:** 私は毎日コーヒー**を**飲みます。 (Watashi wa mainichi kōhī **o** nomimasu.)
-   **English:** I drink coffee every day.
-   **Hindi Logic:** मैं हर दिन कॉफ़ी **को** पीता हूँ। (Main har din coffee **ko** peeta hoon.)
-   **Analysis:** What do you drink? Coffee. Coffee is the direct object of the verb "to drink."

#### **Scenario 2: At Work**

-   **Japanese:** 田中さんはレポート**を**書いています。 (Tanaka-san wa repōto **o** kaite imasu.)
-   **English:** Ms. Tanaka is writing a report.
-   **Hindi Logic:** तनाका-सान एक रिपोर्ट **को** लिख रही हैं। (Tanaka-san ek report **ko** likh rahi hain.)
-   **Analysis:** What is Ms. Tanaka writing? A report. The report is the direct object of the verb "to write."

### **Key Takeaway**

If you can ask "what?" or "whom?" after a verb and get an answer, that answer is the object and must be marked with **を (o)**.

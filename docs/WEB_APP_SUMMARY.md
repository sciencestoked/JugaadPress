## 🎨 Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| **Frontend** | Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS |
| **Backend** | Flask (Python) |
| **Auth** | Google OAuth 2.0 |
| **Storage** | Google Drive API |
| **Session** | Flask sessions (server-side) |
| **Deploy** | Vercel (planned) |

**Cost:** $0 (everything free!)

## 🔐 Security

### What's Secure:
- ✅ OAuth 2.0 (industry standard)
- ✅ Sessions (server-side)
- ✅ HTTPS redirect (in production)
- ✅ Drive scope limited to app files only

### What Needs Work:
- ⚠️ Gmail passwords stored in plaintext (should encrypt)
- ⚠️ No CSRF protection yet (add Flask-WTF)
- ⚠️ Session expires on browser close (should persist)
